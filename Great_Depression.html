      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Great Depression began in 1929 and continued up until the late 1930s and was a world wide economic downturn.
        It was triggered by the crash of the stock market in October 1929. It devastated economies, created an extremely high unemployment rate,
        widespread poverty, and the collapse of thousands of banks and businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its effects permanently changed society in America and American government policy, and created major global
        changes in politics in the years leading up to World War II.

      <h2>Main Causes of the Great Depression</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Stock Market Crash (1929):</strong> Billions of dollars in wealth vanished, triggering panic selling.</li>
        <li><strong>Bank Failures:</strong> More than 9,000 banks collapsed, which wiped out virtually all savings and credit.</li>
        <li><strong>Overproduction:</strong> Industrial and agricultural supply exceeded their demand, causing price drops.</li>
        <li><strong>Decline in Consumer Spending:</strong> A major increase in unemployment led to a significant reduction in economic activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Economic Weakness:</strong> A lot of countries struggled with debt, trade barriers, and instability after World War I.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section: Impact -->
    <section>
      <h2>Impact on American Life</h2>
      <p>
        The Great Depression caused a lot of hardship across the United States. By 1933, unemployment reached nearly 25%.
        Families lost their homes, farms were forced to shut down, and thousands became migrants seeking work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breadlines and soup kitchens became a lot more common, and the emotional effects of poverty changed an entire upcoming generation.
        Rural communities were hit significantly harder, specifically during the Dust Bowl.

      <h2>The New Deal</h2>
      <p>
        In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the New Deal which was a multiple different programs put in place to create
        relief and recovery for the people of the United States. These programs included Social Security, banking regulations, public works employment,
        and agricultural assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The New Deal completely changed the federal government's role in the economy and created safety nets
        that are still in place today.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Long-Term Effects -->
    <section>
      <h2>Long-Term Effects</h2>
      <p>
        The Great Depression changed American politics and the economy. It created a lack of faith in unregulated markets,
        expanded federal authority, and gave a foundation for current financial protections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Globally, the Great Depression created political distress, which assisted in the rise of some extremist groups in Europe.
