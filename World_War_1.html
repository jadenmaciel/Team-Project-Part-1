        <h1>America in World War 1</h1>

            <h2>Neutrality</h2>
            <p>The USA initially remained neutral in the war when it first broke out. The USA held sympathetic feelings towards both the central and allied powers, causing the American people to want to remain neutral in the war, especially the 10% ethnic German population.</p>

            <h2>Booming American War Economy</h2>
            <p>World War 1 initially caused a financial crisis in the United States. European investors sold American securities, causing a drop in price and the New York Stock Exchanged closed its doors and didn't fully reopen for four and a half months. The resulting recession more than doubled the amount of unemployed Americans.</p>
            <p>This crisis only lasted for a few months, as it was soon replace by a business boom as European countries sought to buy American goods because of the war. American exports to Europe more than doubled from 1913 to 1916 while annual European imports dropped by almost a third. Increased demand for American goods resulted in a 30% higher manufacturing index and growth in bank deposits. In addition, unemployment dropped from 2.2 million to about 200,000. The majority of American business became more prosperous, especially the munition and steel manufacturers. This economy boom helped the USA grow into a global economic superpower.</p>
            <p>While the American economy mainly grew because of trade to Europe, it was not without its difficulties because of the war. As a neutral country, the USA traded with both Allied and Central Powers. However, because Europewas at war, both Allied and Central Powers implemented blockades to prevent trade from going to eachother. Allied blockades often resulted in the ship being taken to an Allied port and the cargo siezed, but otherwise the crew was safe. German blockades however were a much different problem for American trade.</p>

            <h2>Unrestricted German U-Boat Warfare</h2>
            <p>American sympathies towards Germany began to decline once Germany began its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, where they sunk passenger ships such as the Lusitania in May of 1915 killing nearly 1,200 passengers, including 128 Americans. The sinking of the Lusitania increased tensions between the USA and Germany causing the Germans to end their unrestricted submarine warfare policy...</p>
            <p>Until May of 1916 when a German U-Boat sinks the SS Sussex and, due to public outrage and an attempt to appease the USA, Germany ends their policy of unrestricted submarine warfare...</p>
            <p>Until early 1917 when Germany decides unrestricted submarine warfare gives Germany a chance to end the war before America can enter. By April, a German U-Boat sinks the American SS Aztec without warning.</p>
            <p>Germany's continued use of unrestricted submarine warfare results in America developing a worsening opinion towards Germany, and the loss of American live from Germany's U-Boat policy play major factors in America's decision to end neutrality</p>

            <h2>Zimmermann Telegram</h2>
            <p>Another major factor in America joining World War 1 was when the Brittish intercepted and decoded the Zimmermann Telegram. This telegram was originally sent to Mexico in an attempt to convince them to invade the USA and join the German cause in exchange for US land should the US join the war. It got intercepted by the Brittish who then alerted America on March 1st, 1917. Ironically, it was this telegram which help galvanize American opinion aginast Germany and cause the USA to join the war.</p>

            <h2>America Enters the War</h2>
            <p>American opinion towards Germany gradually turned sour from Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram, coming to a head on April 2nd, 1917 when US President Woodrow Wilson gave a speech to all of congress in a joint session, and asked for a declaration of war, which was quickly granted. Millions of Americans soon joined the draft, and eventually, the war.</p>

            <h2>War Ends</h2>
            <p>America's arrival onto the European battlefield, with a military force of almost 4 million men and women, soon pushed back the Central Powers. One by one, the Allies with the help of the Americans pushed back the Central powers until they surrendered. Germany was the last one to sign an armistice. On the 11 hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918 (November 11th, 1918 at 11:00 a.m.), the fighting ended.</p>
            <p>After the armistice, the Treaty of Versailles was drafted as the final peace treaty for WWI. The USA sought for the treaty to promote international peace and cooperation based off of President Wilson's "Fourteen Points". Only some of these points were included in the final treaty, including the creation of the League of Nations. While the rest of the European powers soon ratified the Treaty of Versailles, the US Senate failed to ratify the treaty, twice. Eventually, the USA signed separate peace agreements with each European power.</p>
