		<h5>About Me</h5>
		<p>Hello, my name is Jason Maggio. I grew up in Las Vegas but now I live in Utah, otherwise known as the best state! Ever since I was young I had a passion to learn about the past. It didn't matter what the information was about, I was drawn to historical events like a fly to a flame. I started out like any kid egear to learn about dinasours. After I memorized every reptile name, I skipped and moved on to  when humans first started roaming the world. I was facinated with the roamans and the aztecs, mainly about the tactics they used when battling, but also the way their civillization thrived. </p>
