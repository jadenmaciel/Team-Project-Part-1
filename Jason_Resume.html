		<h5>About Me</h5>
		<p>Hello, my name is Jason Maggio.<p>
		<p>I grew up in Las Vegas but now I live in Utah, otherwise known as the best state! </p>
			<p>Ever since I was young I had a passion to learn about the past. </p>
			<p>It didn't matter what the information was about, I was drawn to historical events like a fly to a flame. </p>
			<p>I started out like any kid egear to learn about dinasours. </p>
			<p>After I memorized every reptile name, I skipped and moved on to  when humans first started roaming the world.</p>
			<p>I was facinated with the roamans and the aztecs, mainly about the tactics they used when battling, but also the way their civillization thrived. </p>
			<p>I continued my studdies until I came accross books on WW2. Although I already knew the basic information, I wanted to learn more.</p>
			<p>I learned about their living situations and the impacts it had on the world</p>
			<p>Now I am a professor at SUU teaching about the information I found on World War 2.</p>
