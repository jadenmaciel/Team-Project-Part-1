		<section>
			<h2>Definition and Core Beliefs</h2>
			<p>Manifest Destiny was a nineteenth-century doctrine or belief that the expansion of the United States throughout the American continents was both justified and inevitable. Supporters believed that the United States was destined to expand its control and spread democracy and capitalism across the entire North American continent.</p>
			<p>The belief system argued that it was the nation's duty to settle the continent, conquer, and prosper. It connected nation-building with religion, claiming that America had a divinely ordained mission to settle and civilize the West. This philosophy provided the ideological foundation for aggressive territorial expansion during the 1800s.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- Origins Section: Historical background and early concepts -->
		<section>
			<h2>Origins and Early Ideas</h2>
			<p>While the term "Manifest Destiny" became popular in 1845, the underlying concept began much earlier with the first European immigrants, specifically English Protestants or Puritans who settled in America.</p>
			<p>Puritan leader John Winthrop delivered a sermon in 1630 stressing that their religious settlement must serve as an example. He stated that they would be "as a city upon a hill" and echoed Biblical instructions about the need to expand and prosper, saying "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it."</p>
			<p>The ideology of Manifest Destiny also includes the concept of American exceptionalism, which is the belief that the U.S. occupies a special place among the countries of the world and is inherently different from others. The actual phrase "Manifest Destiny" was coined by American columnist and editor John Louis O'Sullivan in 1845. O'Sullivan first used the phrase in editorials published in July and December of that year to promote the annexation of Texas and the acquisition of the Oregon territory. He wrote that it was "our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us."</p>

		<!-- Territorial Expansion Section: Major land acquisitions and conflicts -->
		<section>
			<h2>Territorial Expansion</h2>
			<p>During the period from 1830 to 1860, the United States vigorously pursued expansion, often willing to use force to secure new territories. This expansionism, the policy of increasing a country's size by expanding its territory, was closely intertwined with Manifest Destiny.</p>
			<img src="images/us-expansion.png" alt="United States Territorial Expansion map from 1783 to 1898 showing all land acquisitions" class="img-fluid rounded mb-3" style="max-width: 100%;">
			<p>The United States acquired vast amounts of new land through several major purchases and conflicts:</p>
			<!-- Ordered List Section: Chronological expansion events -->
			<ol class="mobile">
				<li><strong>Louisiana Purchase (1803):</strong> President Thomas Jefferson initiated westward expansion with the purchase of 828,000 square miles of land from France for $15 million, nearly doubling or tripling the size of the young country. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were charged with exploring and mapping this newly acquired territory.</li>
				<li><strong>Texas Annexation (1845):</strong> Texas was incorporated into the U.S. despite resistance stemming from fears of war with Mexico and opposition related to the expansion of slavery.</li>
				<li><strong>Oregon Territory (1846):</strong> The issue of the disputed Oregon territory, which stretched from the Pacific Coast to the Rocky Mountains, was resolved when the U.S. and Britain agreed to split the region along the 49th parallel, avoiding a crisis.</li>
				<li><strong>Mexican-American War (1846–1848):</strong> Driven by the spirit of Manifest Destiny, the U.S. entered its first offensive war by invading Mexico. The resulting Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) added 525,000 square miles of territory, including all or parts of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.</li>
				<li><strong>Gadsden Purchase (1853):</strong> This purchase finalized the last contiguous land acquisition in the continental U.S., establishing the southern borders of New Mexico and Arizona, primarily intended to allow for the construction of a southern transcontinental railroad route.</li>

		<!-- Consequences Section: Impact on indigenous populations and slavery debate -->
		<section>
			<h2>Justification and Consequences</h2>
			<p>Manifest Destiny provided justification for aggressive territorial expansion and the displacement of indigenous populations. This ideology sanctioned the right to conquer land and displace the "uncivilized," non-Christian peoples who, it was believed, did not take full advantage of the land.</p>
			<p>The Indian Removal Act of 1830 utilized treaty-making to relocate indigenous peoples, and when tribes refused to leave, troops were ordered to forcibly relocate them, resulting in death marches and massive loss of life from violence and disease. This forced displacement of Native Americans remains one of the darkest consequences of Manifest Destiny.</p>

			<!-- Unordered List Section: Key consequences of Manifest Destiny -->
			<h3>Major Consequences</h3>
			<ul class="mobile">
				<li>Forced displacement and relocation of Native American tribes</li>
				<li>Massive loss of life from violence, disease, and death marches</li>
				<li>Intensified debate over slavery in new territories</li>
				<li>Sectional conflict between North and South</li>
				<li>Events like "Bleeding Kansas" that foreshadowed the Civil War</li>
				<li>Rapid territorial expansion doubling the size of the United States</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The rapid acquisition of territory during the first half of the 19th century also fueled the debate over whether new states would be admitted as slave or free states, ultimately intensifying sectional conflict and leading to the Civil War. The addition of these new Western states added to the contention between the North and the South. For instance, the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854) introduced "popular sovereignty" to decide the slavery issue in those territories, which led to violent political confrontations known as "Bleeding Kansas," a significant event that foreshadowed the Civil War.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Cultural Representations and Legacy</h2>
			<p>Artists helped elevate the westward journey to a mythical status, despite the severe hardships faced by pioneers. Works like Emanuel Leutze's mural study, <em>Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way</em> (1861), celebrated the belief that the American West held "unspoiled beauty and infinite promise for a better future." The painting depicts settlers, having overcome hazardous terrain and death, reaching the American West bathed in a welcoming golden light, portraying the frontier as a promised land.</p>

					<p class="text-muted mt-2"><small><em>American Progress by John Gast - A visual representation of Manifest Destiny ideology</em></small></p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>Leutze's painting, executed during the onset of the Civil War, encoded a message of national unity (from Atlantic to Pacific) and served as propaganda for those seeking a brighter future. However, although artists depicted westward expansion as a difficult task leading to a "heavenly reward," actual pioneers often faced arduous journeys lasting five to six months, encountering skirmishes with Native Americans, deadly diseases like cholera and typhoid fever, and finding the destination lonely and inhospitable.</p>
			<p>Manifest Destiny, therefore, provided the ideological foundation for U.S. territorial expansion, justifying the aggressive acquisition of land and the forced displacement of non-European populations, while simultaneously acting as a central catalyst for the national crisis over slavery that would lead to the Civil War.</p>
