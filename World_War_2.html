		<h3>Events leading up to WW2</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt> The Treaty of Versailles </dt>
				<dd>After the events of World War 1, the blame of it all was placed on Germany through the treaty of Versailles. In the treaty there was a war guilt clause which blamed Germany for World War 1, and because of this treaty, Germany lost land and had militarty restrictions. </dd>
			<dt> Economic downturns </dt>
				<dd>The following tragedy that hit Germany was a hyper-inflation in 1923-4. The economy was not doing too great with the inflation of everything, and there was a lot of political insecurities. This fueled the start of Hitlers "career".</dd>
			<dt> Nazi ideology </dt>
				<dd>Due to both the hyper-inflation and the political insecurities, that made the perfect breeding ground for very extremist ideologies. The extreme ideology in question is Nazism. After Hitler created his national pride, he made it his mission to get rid of anyone who his description of supremecy.</dd>
			<dt> The rise of extremism </dt>
				<dd>Sadly after the global crash in 1929, the Great Depression hit hard, and helped create the conditions for Hitler's socialist national party to strive.  Hitler took advantage of Germany's downfall in confidence from the treaty of Versailles and created his own extreme pride in Germany.</dd>
			<dt> The failure of accommodation </dt>
				<dd>Hitler tried to use his power along with his allies to spread his corrupt racial and ideological goals by dominance. Since many people didn't agree with his ideology the Allied Powers fought against the Axis Powers. </dd>
